                <h2>Are there many types of sharks?</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    Sharks are incredibly diverse, with over 500 species spread across various orders. Some of the most well-known types include requiem sharks like the tiger shark and blue shark, which are part of the Carcharhiniformes order. Other popular species include the great white shark, mako shark, and hammerhead shark. Sharks can be found in all the world's oceans, from the frigid waters of the Arctic to the tropical reefs of the Pacific. They are apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain and play a crucial role in regulating the populations of other marine animals. Sharks have a keen sense of smell, excellent eyesight, and can detect electrical signals given off by other animals. They are also known for their incredible speed and agility, allowing them to catch prey with ease.

                <blockquote>
                    Sharks exhibit a wide range of behaviors and adaptations that make them unique among marine animals. Some species, like the great white shark, are known for their migratory patterns, traveling thousands of miles across oceans. Others, like the nurse shark, are more sedentary and prefer to stay in specific habitats such as coral reefs or sandy bottoms.
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    Sharks reproduce in various ways, including oviparity (laying eggs), ovoviviparity (eggs hatch inside the mother, and live young are born), and viviparity (live birth with a placental connection). This diversity in reproductive strategies helps ensure the survival of their species in different environments.
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    Interestingly, sharks have a slow growth rate and late maturity, which makes them particularly vulnerable to overfishing. Many species take years to reach reproductive age, and their populations cannot recover quickly from significant declines. This is why sustainable fishing practices and marine protected areas are essential for their conservation.
