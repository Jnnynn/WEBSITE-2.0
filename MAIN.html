                <h2>What are sharks?</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    Sharks are fascinating marine predators that have been swimming in the world's oceans for over 400 million years. They belong to the class Chondrichthyes, which also includes rays and skates. Sharks are characterized by their streamlined bodies, powerful tails, and a skeleton made of cartilage rather than bone. Their skin is covered with sharp, tooth-like scales called denticles, which help reduce drag as they swim. Sharks come in a wide variety of species, ranging from the small dwarf lanternshark to the massive whale shark, and they play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of marine ecosystems. Despite their fearsome reputation, most sharks are not aggressive towards humans unless provoked.

                <h2>Are there many types of sharks?</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    Sharks are incredibly diverse, with over 500 species spread across various orders. Some of the most well-known types include requiem sharks like the tiger shark and blue shark, which are part of the Carcharhiniformes order. Other popular species include the great white shark, mako shark, and hammerhead shark. Sharks can be found in all the world's oceans, from the frigid waters of the Arctic to the tropical reefs of the Pacific. They are apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain and play a crucial role in regulating the populations of other marine animals. Sharks have a keen sense of smell, excellent eyesight, and can detect electrical signals given off by other animals. They are also known for their incredible speed and agility, allowing them to catch prey with ease.

                <h2>How long have sharks been around?</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    Sharks have been around for an astonishingly long timeâ€”over 400 million years! This means they predate dinosaurs, which first appeared around 230 million years ago. Fossil evidence shows that early sharks were already swimming in Earth's oceans during the Devonian period, often referred to as the "Age of Fishes." Over the millennia, sharks have evolved and adapted to various environmental changes, surviving multiple mass extinction events that wiped out many other species. Their resilience and adaptability make them one of the most successful groups of animals in Earth's history.
