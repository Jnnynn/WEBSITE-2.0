                <blockquote>
                    Sharks have been around for an astonishingly long timeâ€”over 400 million years! This means they predate dinosaurs, which first appeared around 230 million years ago. Fossil evidence shows that early sharks were already swimming in Earth's oceans during the Devonian period, often referred to as the "Age of Fishes." Over the millennia, sharks have evolved and adapted to various environmental changes, surviving multiple mass extinction events that wiped out many other species. Their resilience and adaptability make them one of the most successful groups of animals in Earth's history.

                <blockquote>
                    Sharks have a long and fascinating evolutionary history. They first appeared in the oceans over 400 million years ago, during the Devonian period, which is often called the "Age of Fishes." Early sharks were quite different from modern species, but they laid the groundwork for the diverse array of sharks we see today. Over millions of years, sharks have adapted to various environmental changes and survived multiple mass extinction events, making them one of the oldest surviving vertebrate groups on Earth.
                    Their ability to thrive in different habitats and their unique adaptations have contributed to their success as apex predators in marine ecosystems.

                   Sharks have existed for more than 400 million years, making them one of the oldest creatures on the planet. Their origins trace back to the Devonian period, long before the rise of dinosaurs. Over the ages, sharks have undergone significant evolutionary changes, adapting to shifting climates and oceanic conditions. Despite facing numerous mass extinction events, they have persisted, showcasing their remarkable resilience and adaptability. Today, sharks continue to play a vital role in maintaining the balance of marine ecosystems, a testament to their enduring legacy.
