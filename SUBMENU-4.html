                    Hi Sir. The reason why I added this page is kasi I want to take this opportunity to properly express my gratitude for teaching me, us, kung paano mag coding. I know na we're not exactly good students, to admit it, I know na kupal kami. Kaya sir, sobrang thankful po ako na naging teacher po namin kayo sa css for 1 sem. I know na next year na ikaw yung magiging teacher/adviser namin.
                    Or not, pero either way sir, thank you po for everything. Also, I just want to add na because of you po, I learned how to code, took my time to expand my knowledge kasi na inspire po ako sainyo. At first po talaga, I was really hesitant sa pag take ko ng css/ict strand since I barely know anything about hardware and super out dated po yung coding na I know nung gr10. 
                    But because of you po, I learned how to code and I am somehow confident sa coding skills. I know na I still have a long way to go, pero sir, thank you po for everything. I hope na maging teacher ko po kayo ulit next year. Thank you po ulit sir!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    some of us may not appreciate your efforts in teaching but I assure you sir, that we are thankful for everything you have done for us. 
                    Side note: You're one of the few people na nag inspire sakin to continue this path and I am super thankful sir. Goodbless po!!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Sincerly,
                    <br>
