                <h2>What are sharks?</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    Sharks are fascinating marine predators that have been swimming in the world's oceans for over 400 million years. They belong to the class Chondrichthyes, which also includes rays and skates. Sharks are characterized by their streamlined bodies, powerful tails, and a skeleton made of cartilage rather than bone. Their skin is covered with sharp, tooth-like scales called denticles, which help reduce drag as they swim. Sharks come in a wide variety of species, ranging from the small dwarf lanternshark to the massive whale shark, and they play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of marine ecosystems. Despite their fearsome reputation, most sharks are not aggressive towards humans unless provoked.

                <blockquote>
                    Sharks have an extraordinary sense of smell, allowing them to detect a single drop of blood in an Olympic-sized swimming pool. They also have specialized sensory organs called ampullae of Lorenzini, which enable them to detect the electric fields produced by other animals. This helps them locate prey even in complete darkness or murky waters. Sharks are apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain, and their presence helps regulate the populations of other marine species. Unfortunately, many shark species are now threatened due to overfishing, habitat destruction, and the demand for shark fins. Conservation efforts are critical to ensure the survival of these incredible creatures for future generations.

                <blockquote>
                    Sharks exhibit a wide range of behaviors and adaptations that make them unique among marine animals. Some species, like the great white shark, are known for their migratory patterns, traveling thousands of miles across oceans. Others, like the nurse shark, are more sedentary and prefer to stay in specific habitats such as coral reefs or sandy bottoms.

                    Sharks reproduce in various ways, including oviparity (laying eggs), ovoviviparity (eggs hatch inside the mother, and live young are born), and viviparity (live birth with a placental connection). This diversity in reproductive strategies helps ensure the survival of their species in different environments.

                    Interestingly, sharks have a slow growth rate and late maturity, which makes them particularly vulnerable to overfishing. Many species take years to reach reproductive age, and their populations cannot recover quickly from significant declines. This is why sustainable fishing practices and marine protected areas are essential for their conservation.

                    Sharks also play a vital role in marine ecosystems by keeping prey populations in check and removing sick or weak individuals, which helps maintain the health of the ocean. Their presence is an indicator of a balanced and thriving marine environment.
